Description: Xen API blktap shared library (development files)
 The Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) is an open source enterprise-ready server
 virtualization and cloud computing platform, delivering the Xen Hypervisor
 with support for a range of guest operating systems. This package is part
 of it. It implements the userland part of the blktap driver.
 .
 Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) is a file format standard which maps logical hard disk
 contents to a physical disk image format, which can then be more efficiently
 stored in a variety of different storage types, such as file systems or
 logical volumes.
 .
 VHDs are container files storing block metadata alongside a virtual disk's
 contents, in a single disk image. The metadata enables advanced storage
 backend capabilities, such as thin provisioning, disk image snapshotting, and
 coalescing of differencing disks.
 .
 Libvhd is a library to access VHD format metadata. It provides disk image
 initialization, inspection and manipulation to both VHD user utilities and
 the VHD disk driver in Blktap.
 .
 This package contains the development files

 This package contains user utilities to inspect, test, and manipulate
 Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) images through libvhd, and the control utilities
 needed to create destroy and manipulate devices ('tap-ctl'), the 'tapdisk'
 driver program to perform tap devices I/O, and a number of image drivers.
